<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I was that girl 5’3" with big brown eyes,<br />
long curly hair and luscious thighs.<br />
had a smile that lit up my way,<br />
but I was hurting at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Wearing lenghas, sarees, salwar kameez and anarkali’s,<br />
my gold bangles shining a mile away.<br />
My tikka shaping my face,<br />
speaking Gujarati loud enough-<br />
for the whole neighborhood to hear.<br />
Embracing my Indian culture at last.<br />
<br />
Why did I let my culture go?<br />
<br />
Looking at myself in the mirror,<br />
I thought, “who is this?”.<br />
Where was the proud brown girl,<br />
the same girl who once proudly embraced her culture? <br />
<br />
I finally had the courage to put on a saree, <br />
twirling around like a princess.<br />
I felt everything was going to be okay again.<br />
I will be able to get through this, 
whatever this was.<br />
<br />
I walked out my room like a Bollywood princess.<br />
My parents even complimented me,<br />
and so did my siblings.<br />
They saw a change in me,<br />
and so did I</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>I miss you so much, <br />
you have no idea.<br />
I think about you,<br />
even though I know you don’t think about me.<br />
I wish nothing but the best for you.<br />
<br />
I wish I didn’t lose you,<br />
because you were my best friend.<br />
You dealt with me and i was there for you,<br />
but fate works in a weird way.<br />
<br />
I deleted your number, <br />
but you texted me three months later,<br />
saying you were sorry.<br />
I recognized your number right away.<br />
<br />
You pushed me away multiple times,<br />
but we always came back to one another.<br />
This time it was different.<br />
It felt different.<br />
I felt different. <br />
<br />
If you came back to my life again,<br />
I would accept you with arms wide open.<br />
Call me stupid,<br />
but you were my best friend.<br />
Even though you really broke my heart,<br />
I’ll always forgive you.<br />
<br />
I learned friends can break hearts too.<br />
<br />
Everything between us is ruined,<br />
but I forgive you.<br />
I hold no grudge against you.<br />
I wish for you  to know that. <br />
<br />
It’s time to put it all behind me,<br />
all the laughing,<br />
the crying,<br />
late night talking,<br />
stupid fights,<br />
birthdays,<br />
five years.<br />
It's time to move forward,<br />
to new beginnings <br />
<br />
I knew I'd be okay,<br />
with or without ya’.<br />
<br />
One day out of the blue you text me,<br />
saying you’re sorry.<br />
I recognize your number right away-<br />
and, as always I accept your apology.<br />
<br />
I told my boyfriend about you and fought for your friendship,<br />
only for you to turn your back on me again.<br />
You’re back to your old ways again.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of thinking that I did wrong,<br />
when I haven’t done anything at all.<br />
I’m tired of fighting for a friendship that’s one sided.<br />
<br />
Finally I decided,<br />
enough was enough.<br />
It was my turn.<br />
I blocked your number,<br />
and haven’t looked back since.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>How can we be friends,<br />
when I’m the only one that does all the talking?<br />
My eyes light up when you barely say a couple of words.<br />
I’m hoping you open up to me.<br />
<br />
Everytime I confront you,<br />
I feel like you lie to me,<br />
or hide things from me,<br />
to keep me on my toes.<br />
<br />
You say you care about me,<br />
you worry about me,<br />
I mean something to you,<br />
but i call bullshit.<br />
<br />
I try and I try,<br />
to show you I’m not like your ex,<br />
or the last person you wanted to date,<br />
but it’s like I fail every time,<br />
and you don’t notice any of the things I do for you.<br />
<br />
I saw you at your worst and- <br />
still thought you were the best.<br />
<br />
How can you say you appreciate me and-<br />
the things I’ve done for you,<br />
when you don’t show the appreciation? <br />
When have you gone out of your way for me?<br />
<br />
You just assume I’m fine,<br />
and I’ll come talk to you.<br />
You just walk away,<br />
pretending that everything's okay.<br />
<br />
In between the phone calls,<br />
you coming by my desk,<br />
visiting me,<br />
calling me,<br />
talking to me.<br />
The late night calls,<br />
sleeping over.<br />
I started to like you,<br />
and I knew that was a big mistake.<br />
<br />
You told me you won’t put yourself out there for me,<br />
but you’ve done it before with the wrong people.<br />
It’s not like I treat you like garbage.<br />
<br />
The biggest mistake I made,<br />
was letting my pride down,<br />
letting my ego down,<br />
letting my cockiness down,<br />
and telling you that I like you-<br />
and I genuinely care about you.<br />
<br />
Deep down inside,<br />
I know that you know, <br />
you hurt the one person God sent to heal you.<br />
<br />
You asked for space because you had a lot of things going on.<br />
You needed to figure things out.<br />
Your behavior was different.<br />
<br />
I would text you and ask you if you were okay.<br />
your one word replies made me not want to text you anymore.<br />
<br />
You would talk to everyone around me,<br />
except for me.<br />
<br />
By that point,<br />
I tolerated enough.<br />
I gave you all the space in the world.<br />
I didn’t bother texting you,<br />
or looking your way.<br />
<br />
No more checking up on you.<br />
No more buying you anything.<br />
No more worrying about you.<br />
No more going out of my way for you.<br />
It’s time I pretend I don’t care about you,<br />
It’s for the best.<br />
<br />
We found our way back to each other,<br />
as always,<br />
but this time,<br />
everything was different.<br />
<br />
For some odd reason,<br />
I couldn’t let you go.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>My sweet baby boy,<br />
you are the greatest thing that’s happened to me,<br />
truly a blessing.<br />
<br />
Your round eyes remind me of me.<br />
Your curly hair reminds me of your dad.<br />
Those chubby cheeks, that I could kiss all day.<br />
<br />
I’m trying so hard, <br />
to be a better person for you,<br />
learning how to take care of you,<br />
and hold you.<br />
I try to soothe you when you cry,<br />
forgive me if I don’t do a good job,<br />
or get frustrated.<br />
<br />
There are times when I feel,<br />
like I’m a horrible mother to you,<br />
when I get frustrated with you.<br />
<br />
It upsets me when I can’t calm you down,<br />
and the tears are running down your cheeks.<br />
I’m sorry for hurting you in anyway.<br />
<br />
I hope when you grow up,<br />
you will realize everything I’m doing for you,<br />
all the long hours,<br />
not being home,<br />
barely spending any time with you,<br />
just to make money for your future.<br />
<br />
And yes,<br />
it does kill me,<br />
not to hold you in my arms.<br />
<br />
When you grow up,<br />
I hope you realize how loved you are,<br />
even though my family isn’t around.<br />
<br />
You’ll have so many questions,<br />
and in time I’ll tell you all my truths.<br />
<br />
I pray that you don’t blame yourself,<br />
because it’s not your fault.<br />
<br />
Everything I do,<br />
is for you,<br />
for your future,<br />
your happiness.<br />
<br />
I hope I make you proud one day,<br />
and you’re able to call me a good mom,<br />
because, sweetie-<br />
I’m doing my best,<br />
and I know I’m far from perfect.<br />
<br />
But you, my sweet boy,<br />
are perfect in my eyes.<br />
<br />
No matter what happens,<br />
you’ll always have me,<br />
right by your side.<br />
<br />
I love you so much,<br />
my sweet little angel.</p>
